## Running this project 

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:1234` by default, but will use another port
number if `1234` is being used by another application.

- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm install` to download the project's dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to compile the project and spin up a dev server on `localhost`.
